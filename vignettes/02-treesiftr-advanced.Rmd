# Introduction

treesiftr is an R package [@R] for visualizing the relationship between phylogenetic 
trees and phylogenetic data. Phylogenetic trees are crucial to the study of 
comparative biology, taxonomy, and evolution. However, understanding how to read 
a phylogenetic tree, and how a phylogenetic tree relates to underlying 
phylogenetic data, remains challenging.

In today's lab exercise, we will learn about the data in a phylogenetic matrix,
and then use these data in the matrix to visualize a phylogenetic tree. We will use 
RStudio [@RStudio] to conduct our exercise.

## The fossil bear matrix

The data matrix included with treesiftr is a matrix of binary ("0" and "1") 
characters compiled to estimate a topology of living and extinct bear species [@abella12]. This matrix is fairly typical in size for a paleontological matrix, comprising 62 characters. It is, however, atypically complete, with only 18% 
missing data. In the following exercises, missing data will be represented by 
a thin black line. The "0" state will be represented in pale blue, and the "1" 
in brown.

## treesiftr

treesiftr works by subsetting a phylogenetic matrix using the `start`, `stop` 
and `step` arguments. The `start` argument controls where in the matrix you 
would like to begin visualizing characters. For example, a start value of 1 would indicate to begin visualizing characters from the first character in the matrix. 
The `stop` value indicates what will be the first character in the last 
visualization. A stop value of 10 would indicate that the first character in the 
last visualization should be character 10. The `step` value indicates how many characters at once to visualize. A step value of three would indicate characters 
should be viewed in threes. For example, if `start` = 1, `stop` = 10, and 
step = `3`, 10 visualizations will be produced. The first will visualize 
characters 1, 2, and 3. The final will be characters 10, 11, and 12. 

A [maximum parsimony](#glossary) tree is then estimated from each dataset. The 
tree is [scored](#glossary) under both parsimony and Lewis' Mk model [@Lewis2001] 
for discrete character data. The data and tree are then visualized using ggtree, based upon the ggplot2 package. This application makes use of Shiny to provide a graphical interface, but in this tutorial, we will use the R Studio interface to visualize our data.

## Installation

Currently, treesiftr can be installed via the devtools ```install_github```
function. treesiftr has a number of required packages. Install and load the below. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("wrightaprilm/treesiftr")
library(treesiftr)
library(phangorn)
library(alignfigR)
library(ggtree)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Subsetting the phylogenetic matrix

The first step to making a treesiftr visualization is to select the subset of 
the phylogenetic matrix that we would like to visualize. This is performed via a function called ```generate_sliding```. The below command will subset the  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
# Locate package data and read alignment 
fdir <- system.file("extdata", package = "treesiftr") 
aln_path <- file.path(fdir, "bears_fasta.fa")
bears <- alignfigR::read_alignment(aln_path)
# Read in a starting phylogenetic tree
tree <- ape::read.tree(file.path(fdir, "starting_tree.tre"))

# Generate our list of dataframe subsets
sample_df <- generate_sliding(bears, start_char = 1, stop_char = 5, steps = 1)
```

The result of this is a dataframe, shown below:

```{r}
sample_df
```
This dataframe dispays the start character (the first character that will be visualized) and stop character (the final character that will be visualized). 

We can then build trees from each subset:

```{r, message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment =                                                     aln_path, tree = tree, phy_mat = bears)
```

The above code saves the trees to a vector, but does not visualize them. They can
be visualized by naming the vector, like so:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
output_vector 
```

`Phangorn` [@Schliep2011, Schliep2017] requires a starting tree to estimate a parsimony tree. We specify the tree we read in earlier for this purpose. The trees, which were generated with `ggtree` [@ggtree] have been saved to a vector, which can be displayed in its entirety, or subsetted to look at specific trees.

## Questions

1. Visualize characters 1 and 2. What is the parsimony score for this character 
set? Once you have answered this question,check your answer by adding the 
parismony score using the `pscore` argument:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment =                                                     aln_path, tree = tree, phy_mat = bears,
                                   pscore = TRUE)
```

2. Visualize character set 2-3 and 3-4. What [monophyletic](#glossary) group from the 
tree for characters 2-3 is no longer on the tree for characters 3-4?

3. Visualize characters 1 and 2. This time, add the flag `random_tree = TRUE`, like so:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment =                                                     aln_path, tree = tree, phy_mat = bears,
                      pscore = TRUE, random_tree = TRUE)
```
Are the parsimony scores larger or smaller than those of the character on an estimated tree?
Does this make sense to you? Why?
 
4. View a tree of characters 8 - 10. Which character, 8, 9 or 10, represents a [reversal](#glossary) from a [derived](#glossary) state to [ancestral](#glossary)?

5. What information would we need to decide if the "1" state possesed by _Zaragocyon_daamsi_ in character 52 is an [autapomorphy](#glossary)? 

6. You can add the likelihood score to the visualization using the below 
code:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment =                                                     aln_path, tree = tree, phy_mat = bears, 
                                   pscore = TRUE, lscore = TRUE)
```

Does the character set 8, 9, and 10 have the same parsimony score as the character set 9, 10, and 11? How about the same likelihood score?

7. Compare characters 46-49 and 47-50. Why does set 47-50 have a better 
likelihood than 46-49? 

8. What is the relationship between the likelihood score and increasing the 
number of characters visualized? 

9. What is the minimum number adding a parsimony-informative character can add 
to the parsimony score?

10. These trees are fully resolved. Based on your exploration of the data, does 
this degree of resolution make sense? Take a look at characters 1-3, for example.
Does displaying a fully resolved tree make sense for these characters?

## Glossary

_Ancestral State_: A character state possessed by the ancestor of a group

_Autapomorphy_: A character state that is unique to a specific taxon.

_Derived State_: A character state that is different from the ancestral state.

_Likelihood Score_: The likelihood of the observed data under a specific 
model.

_Maximum likelihood_: A phylogenetic optimatlity criterion under which phylogenetic
data are modeled according to sets of assumptions. Under this criterion, the tree
that has the best ("maximum") likelihood score under the assumed model is to be preferred.

_Maximum parsimony_: A phylogenetic optimality criterion. This criterion holds 
that the tree implying the fewest changes in the characters used to generate it
should be preferred.

_Monophyletic_: A group on a phylogeny of an ancestor and all of its descendents.

_Parsimony Score_: The number of changes implied by a character on a tree.

_Resolved_: A node that is bifucating, leaving two descendent lineages.

_Reversal_: A change from the derived state back to the ancestral state.
